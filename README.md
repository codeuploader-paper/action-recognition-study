# Action Recognition Study

This repository contains a general implementation of 6 representative 2D and 3D approaches for action recognition including I3D [1], ResNet3D [2], S3D [3], R(2+1)D [4], TSN [5] and TAM [6]. 

Results of mini-datasets and full-datasets can be found at [mini-datasets](./benchmark_mini.md) and [full-datasets](./benchmark_full.md). The trained models will be released soon.

## Requirements

```
pip install -r requirement.txt
```

## Data Preparation
The dataloader (utils/video_dataset.py) can load videos (image sequences) stored in the following format:
```
-- dataset_dir
---- train.txt
---- val.txt
---- test.txt
---- videos
------ video_0_folder
-------- 00001.jpg
-------- 00002.jpg
-------- ...
------ video_1_folder
------ ...
```

Each line in `train.txt` and `val.txt` includes 4 elements and separated by a symbol, e.g. space or semicolon. 
Four elements (in order) include (1)relative paths to `video_x_folder` from `dataset_dir`, (2) starting frame number, usually 1, (3) ending frame number, (4) label id (a numeric number).

E.g., a `video_x` has `300` frames and belong to label `1`.
```
path/to/video_x_folder 1 300 1
```
The difference for `test.txt` is that each line will only have 3 elements (no label information).

After that, you need to update the `utils/data_config.py` for the datasets accordingly.

We provided three scripts in the `tools` folder to help convert some datasets but the details in the scripts must be set accordingly. E.g., the path to videos.


## Training and Evaluation
The `opts.py` illustrates the available options for training 2D and 3D models. Some options are only for 2D models or 3D models.

You can get help via
```
python3 train.py --help
```


Here is an example to train a `64-frame I3D` on the `Kinetics400` datasets with `Uniform Sampling` as input.

```
python3 train.py --datadir /path/to/folder --threed_data \
--dataset kinetics400 --frames_per_group 1 --groups 8 \
--logdir snapshots/ --lr 0.01 --backbone_net i3d -b 64 -j 64
```

To evaluate a model with more crops and clips, we provided `test.py` to support those variants. 
The `test.py` shares the same `opts.py` to `train.py`, so most of settings are the same.
Furthermore, you can set `num_crops` and `num_clips` for `test.py`.

Here is an example to evaluate on the above model with 3 crops and 3 clips

```
python3 test.py --datadir /path/to/folder --threed_data \
--dataset kinetics400 --frames_per_group 1 --groups 8 \
--logdir snapshots/ --lr 0.01 --backbone_net i3d -b 64 -j 64 \
-e --pretrained /path/to/file --num_clips 3 --num_crops 3
```
